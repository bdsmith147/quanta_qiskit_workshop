# Instructions for Quanta Student Symposium Workshop

You are not expected to be an expert. The purpose is to provide an opportunity to play with quantum circuits

Disclaimer: The Quanta Symposium organizers didn't write these labs and exercises. They have 

Warnings:
* Some of the pre-written functions may be deprecated. In that case, you will have to find the correct functions to replace these with.

Tips for when you get stuck:
* Google is your friend. 
* It may be helpful to review some of the Prerequisite and Other Relevant Material at the beginning of each lab.
* There are also links throughout the labs to relevant portions of the Qiskit textbook. 

* The Qiskit documentation on particular functions can be helpful.


[Here's a document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-textbook/main/content/ch-states/supplements/single-gates-cheatsheet.pdf) listing many different single qubit quantum gates as they appear in Qiskit.
